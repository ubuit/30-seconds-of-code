# WARNING!

The `_30s` module is not production ready. Do NOT use it in production websites.
It is strictly for testing purposes at this moment in time. Snippets do not have
any unit tests written and will not be reliable.

Snippet names can and will change without notice between minor versions.

Given the version `0.x.y`:

* `x` indicates a snippet name change.
* `y` indicates a new snippet or fix.

If your project is not serious and you do not care about the above issues, you will want
to use the `es5` version and also include `babel-polyfill` for widest browser support.
