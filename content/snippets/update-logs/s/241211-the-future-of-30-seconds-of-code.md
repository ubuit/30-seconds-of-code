Hey there! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

Thought I'd pop in to share some thoughts and news about the website, where it's headed and what I've been up to lately. This is the first of - hopefully - many updates to come on the regular.

This week marks the **7-year anniversary** of 30 seconds of code. It's been an incredible journey so far, and I'm grateful for all the support the project has received over the years. I've learned a lot, met amazing people and grown as a developer and person.

However, after the initial excitement and growth, the team quickly dwindled and, eventually, I was left on my own to maintain the project. This has been a challenge, to say the least. I've been juggling a full-time job, personal life and the website, and it's been tough to keep up with everything.

This is by no means goodbye, on the contrary it's a **new beginning**, one I'm quite excited about. For a while now, I've been working to make the development and content creation experience as seamless as possible, in hopes I can write more valuable content more often.

You may have noticed the frequent infrastructure touch-ups, content reorganization and the overall shift towards a different style of content that looks and feels very different from what initially made up the bulk of the website. The shift towards **long-form content and deeper dives** was intentional, as I want to make the content more valuable and engaging.

At the same time, as I've maintained the project on my own for a while now, it's high time to call it what it is - **a personal coding blog**. It started pretty much as such, gathering the tidbits of knowledge I deemed useful, and it's now returning to its roots.

So what does this mean for the future? Mainly, that I'll share more deep dives like [Modeling complex JavaScript object collections in memory](/js/s/complex-object-collections-in-memory), opinion pieces, personal experiences, thoughts and insights. I'll keep on sharing short snippet content from time to time, but I'm happier writing more in-depth content than content that AI can generate for you at a moment's notice.

As mentioned already, my time and energy is limited, so **community contributions will stay closed**, same as they have been for quite a while now. I know I'm shooting myself in the foot a little bit by not allowing the community to point out mistakes and omissions, but this isn't a permanent solution. As soon as the website is sufficiently close to what I've envisioned, I'll revise guidelines and open up contributions again.

Thanks again for sticking around for this long, and I hope you'll enjoy the new content as much as I enjoy writing it. Here's to 7 more years of 30 seconds of code! ðŸŽ‰
