Hello everyone! <span class="wave">👋</span>

A quick update just in case you missed it: I recently rebased the entire history of the repository to clean up a lot of irrelevant commits and tidy up a lot of mishaps we've had over the years (committing `node_modules` to git, hundreds of almost empty Travis CI builds in line etc.).

Hopefully, I didn't mess anything up and it's all nice and tidy and trimmed down by about 3k commits. I'll take a second look if there's any more work that can be done to make everything a little cleaner.

If you notice anything odd, feel free to point it out. I'll keep the `master-backup` branch around for a few days in case there are any issues.

Cheers! 🍻
