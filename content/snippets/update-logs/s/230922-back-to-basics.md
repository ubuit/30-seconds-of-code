Hey everyone! <span class="wave">üëã</span>

I know it's been a little while and the Pull Requests have been piling up for a few weeks now. I promise I'll look into your ideas and comments as soon as I have some time, which will be this week hopefully!

In the meantime, we're going back to basics with the web infrastructure and design guideline repositories being merged into this repository once and for all. At the time of the project's rapid growth, it made sense to have decentralized infrastructure across multiple repositories, but now it's more of a hassle than a scalability solution. Thus, the entire stack is now housed in this repository, making it easier to develop new features and content.

I've also automated a lot of the labeling and deployment via GitHub Actions, this will make life a lot easier and ensure there are no unnecessary deployments. More automation coming soon, hopefully, making content creation easier and more streamlined.

That's about everything for today. I'm hoping to post more status and product updates over the coming weeks and share some exciting news.

Cheers! üçª
