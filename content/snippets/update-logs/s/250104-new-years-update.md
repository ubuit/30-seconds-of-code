Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰

I hope you had a great holiday season and that you're ready to tackle the new year head-on. I know I am! Here's a quick update on what's new and what's to come in 2025.

## Community involvement

Community contributions have been restricted in one form or another for the better part of the past two years. As mentioned in previous updates, **my time and energy are limited**, and I've been focusing on creating content that I believe is valuable and engaging, rather than engaging in often unfruitful discussions with new contributors.

I still believe hit-and-run contributions to be problematic and what people perceive as interesting may not align fully with my vision, interests and time constraints. However, closing off contributions entirely is seeing everything as a nail when you have a hammer.

To amend this situation, **I will allow community contributions on GitHub** again. Here's the catch, however: For the time being, I will only be looking at **bug fixes, typos and small improvements**. I will not be accepting new content submissions, as I want to focus on creating content that aligns with my vision for the website.

To spice things up, I'm setting up **discussions on GitHub for new articles**, so that the community can provide feedback, jam on ideas and react to new content when it's published. Keep an eye out for links at the end of articles to join the discussion!

## About page facelift

The **About page** has been updated to reflect the current state of the website and my intentions for the future. It's a bit more personal now, and I hope it gives you a better idea of who I am and what I'm trying to achieve with 30 seconds of code.

At the same time, the **FAQ page** is gone, as its content has been merged into the About page. I've also updated the footer links to reflect these changes.

## Journeys

The articles I've been working on in the past month or so are all part of the newly released [Complex objects](/js/s/complex-objects/p/1) collection. As this series is meant to be read in order, I've finally added a long standing backlog feature: **Journeys**.

Journeys are a way to navigate through a series of articles in a collection, making it easier to follow along with the content. At the end of each article, you'll find a **pagination component**, similar to the one you see on collection pages, that allows you to navigate to the next or previous article in the series.

I'm hoping to add this feature to more collections in the future, quite possibly retroactively to some of the older ones as well (hint: **JavaScript Interview Questions** might be next).

## Terminology update

For a while now, the terminology of the website has been a little ambiguous. What's an **article** and what's a **snippet**? Historically, this started out as a way to separate long-form content from shorter form code snippets, yet it has become a bit of a mess right now.

To minimize reader confusion, I've basically updated the terminology to be as simple as possible. Every content page is now an article, plain and simple, whereas snippet is the term I use to refer to the individual pieces of code. Hopefully, I've managed to catch most of the references, but if you see any remnants of the old terminology, please let me know!

That's it for now! I hope you're as excited as I am for the new year and the new content that's coming your way. As the community gets more involved, I'm sure we'll start some interesting discussions and learn new things together.

Here's to a great 2025! ðŸš€
