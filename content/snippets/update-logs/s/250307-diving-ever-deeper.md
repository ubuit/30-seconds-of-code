Hey there! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>

Thought I'd take a break from coding to bring you an update on what's been going on behind the scenes, both project-wise and community-wise.

## Content focus

As you may well be aware by now, most of my recent articles are focused on **larger projects and deeper dives** into various topics. This is a trend I hope to continue for the rest of the year.

The reason for this is twofold. First and foremost, **I enjoy challenging myself** and learning new things and I think that my writing and coding outside of work was a little stale the past few months, or, dare I say, years.

Secondly, I think that there is **too much beginner content** and focus on specific tools out there, but not enough content to incite curiosity and facilitate discovery.

## Community update

After a few months of having **community contributions** open on GitHub, I haven't noticed any adverse effects, like the spam of the past.

However, there's one little thing I want to address and that is **GitHub Discussions**. I find that they don't contribute much to the overall community-building aspect, nor do they drive engagement. They're also a hassle to plan when writing content ahead of time, as I usually do, especially when working on advanced topics that span multiple articles.

Overall, I'm certain this experiment has failed and I'll be **sunsetting** the discussions aspect of the community pretty soon. You will still be able to open issues and PRs, though, so don't worry about that.

That's it for now. Catch me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Chalarangelo), if you haven't already. I've been working on some [cool stuff](https://github.com/Chalarangelo/readex) that I hope to share with you in future articles.

Until next time! ðŸš€
