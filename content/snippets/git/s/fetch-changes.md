Keeping in sync with the latest changes from the remote repository is essential when working with Git. The `git fetch` command allows you to **retrieve the latest changes** from the remote repository without applying them to your local repository. This can be useful when you want to see what changes have been made before merging them into your local branch.

```shell
# Syntax: git fetch

git fetch
# Fetches the latest updates from the remote
```
