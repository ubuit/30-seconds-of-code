      <p>
        I started 30 seconds of code in <strong>2017</strong> as a side project to
        help me and others learn new things and improve their coding skills, by providing
        <strong>free access</strong> to curated content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, a <strong>large community of contributors</strong>
        has formed around it, creating hundreds of short code snippets and programming
        articles, as well as helping me maintain and curate the content on the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        In recent years, the community aspect has simmered down a bit, but I'm
        still commited to creating and maintaining a <strong
          >high-quality resource</strong
        > to help developers learn and grow. Nowadays, I treat the project more as
        a <strong>personal blog</strong>, where I share my thoughts and ideas on
        software development and dive into interesting programming topics.

        If you find a <strong
          >bug, typo, omission, or any other content issue</strong
        >, you can use the <strong>GitHub link on the article page</strong>
        to find the matching file and then <strong>open an issue</strong> describing
        the problem. This is the best way to help me keep the content up-to-date
        and accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any <strong>other content contributions</strong> (e.g. new articles) are
        currently not accepted and will most likely be closed without review. This
        is due to a <strong>lack of time</strong> and not because I don't appreciate
        your effort. I'm always happy to see people interested in contributing and
        hope to be able to discuss new topic ideas with you in the future.
